## Hello World Terraform

[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool that provides a consistent CLI workflow to manage hundreds of cloud services. Terraform codifies cloud APIs into declarative configuration files.

On this example we can see the structure used to create an [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) integrated with an [API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/)

I included a [role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html) and a [policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_identity-vs-resource.html) to make it a bit more complete.
